My project focused on enhancing ORC-JIT and by introducing a new feature for advanced symbol resolution, aimed at improving runtime symbol handling and flexibility. Mentors : Vassil Vassilev, Aaron Jomy Overview of the Project Clang-Repl is an interactive C++ interpreter built on top of LLVM’s ORC JIT, enabling incremental compilation and execution. However, when user code references symbols from external libraries, those libraries must currently be loaded manually. This happens because ORC JIT does not automatically resolve symbols from libraries that haven’t been loaded yet...",

The Problem: Information Overload LLVM generates a wealth of valuable data during compilation-optimization, including optimization remarks, profiling information, timing data, and more.

The Problem We're Solving At the start of the program, I wrote about the fundamental gap in LLVM's target abstraction. The promise is simple: frontends emit LLVM IR, and LLVM handles everything else.

However, some operations rely on system calls, like , which is done via a remote procedure call (RPC) to the CPU, like the image below shows. GPU writes to mailbox. This approach uses a mailbox that is read by a user-level polling thread and transfer...",

The main objective of this project was to develop microbenchmarking infrastructure for libc on the GPU. Background The LLVM libc project was designed as an alternative to glibc that aims to be modular, configurable, and sanitizer-friendly. Currently, LLVM libc is being ported to Nvidia and AMD GPUs to give libc functionality (e.g. printf(), malloc(), and math functions) on the GPU. As of March 2024, programs can use GPU libc in offloading languages (CUDA, OpenMP) or through direct compilation and linking with the libc library. What We Did During...",

While compilers excel at including source code positions (such as line and column numbers) in these generated messages, it would be advantageous if these reports also contained the corresponding source-level expressions.

It is possible to get nice output with the stream operators, but it is very verbose due to the stream manipulators. The other option is using printf , which is convenient but only supports a limited number of types and is not extendable. A non-standard option is using the {fmt} library. This article provides a short introduction to the parts of this library that were standardized in C++20 as std::format , as well as the current implementation status in LLVM 15.

Exploration and prototyping is slowed down by the long edit-compile-run cycles during development.

This patch is currently designed to track N2472 , a proposal being actively considered by the ISO WG14 C Language Committee.

In comparison to the LLVM developer meetings, this dev room offers more of an opportunity to meet up with developers from a very wide range of open source projects. As in previous years, the...",

In the class declaration below, S::foo() will be exported when building a DLL: struct __declspec(dllexport) S { void foo() {} }; and code using that DLL would typically see a declaration like this: struct __declspec(dllimport) S { void foo() {} }; to indicate...",

We’ve written about this several times in the past, and we’ve had full ABI compatibility (minus bugs) for some time. One area that been notoriously hard to achieve compatibility on has been debug information, but over the past 2 years we’ve made significant leaps. If you just want the TL;DR, then here you go: If you’re using clang on Windows, you can now get PDB debug information! Background: CodeView vs. PDB CodeView is a debug information format invented by Microsoft in the mid 1980s. For various reasons, other debuggers developed...",

With our next release though, we're changing this. The LLVM version number will now increase by \"1.0\" with every major release, which means that the first major release after LLVM 4.0 will be LLVM 5.0 (expected September 2017). We believe that this approach will provide a simpler and more standard approach to versioning.

However, as the Foundation was created we saw a need for help in other areas related to the LLVM project, compilers, and tools. The LLVM Foundation has established...",

We are happy to announce that it has reached a significant milestone: it is now able to bootstrap LLVM, Clang, and itself and pass all tests on x86-64 Linux and FreeBSD with the speed expected of an LLVM project. ELF is the standard file format for executables on Unix-like systems, such as Linux and BSDs. GNU ld and GNU gold are commonly used linkers for such systems today. In many use cases, the linker is a black box for which only speed matters. Depending on program size, linking a program...",

The bugpoint tool helps to reduce an input IR file while preserving some interesting behavior, usually a compiler crash or a miscompile. Multiple strategies are involved in the reduction of the test case (shuffling instructions, modifying the control flow, etc.), but because it is oblivious...",

Now we’ve closed the loop and started to fuzz parts of LLVM (including Clang) using LLVM itself. LibFuzzer , recently added to the LLVM tree, is a library for in-process fuzzing that uses Sanitizer Coverage instrumentation to guide test generation. With LibFuzzer one can implement a guided fuzzer for some library by writing one simple function: extern \"C\" void TestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size)...",

As you can read in the announcement email , the switch happened without many issues. Performance stayed roughly the same, binary size decreased by about 8%. In this post I'd like to discuss the motivation for this switch. Motivation There are two reasons for the switch. 1. Many Chromium developers already used clang on Linux. We've supported opting in to clang for since before clang supported C++ – because of this, we have a process in place for shipping new...",

It has been discussed previously on this blog in 2012 and 2013 , as well as at FOSDEM 2014 , and at Apple's WWDC 2013 . The LLVM loop vectorizer combines multiple iterations of a loop to improve performance. Modern processors can exploit the independence of the interleaved instructions using advanced hardware features, such as multiple execution units and out-of-order execution, to improve performance. Unfortunately, when loop vectorization is not possible or profitable the loop is silently skipped. This is a problem for many applications that rely on the performance vectorization provides.

A major part of that effort was the introduction of the Fourth Tier LLVM (FTL) JIT. The Fourth Tier JIT targets long-running JavaScript content and performs a level of optimization beyond WebKit's interpreter, baseline JIT, and high-level optimizing JIT. See the FTL Optimization Strategy section below for more on WebKit's tiered optimizations. The engineering advancements within WebKit that made the FTL possible were described by Filip Pizlo in the Surfin' Safari Blog post, Introducing the WebKit FTL JIT . On April 29, 2014, the WebKit team enabled FTL by default on trunk: r167958...",

This link provide more specific details. In February we reached an exciting milestone that we can self-host Clang and LLVM using clang-cl (without fallback), and both projects pass all of their tests! Additionally both Chrome and Firefox now compile successfully with fallback! Here are some of the highlights of recent improvements: Microsoft compatible record layout is done!

For example, a typical command to compile a file into an executable with Clang might be \"clang hello.cc -o hello\", whereas with cl.exe, one would use \"cl.exe hello.cc /Fehello\". Now one can use the latter syntax with Clang by substituting \"cl.exe\" with \"clang-cl\". This makes it easy to use Clang for existing...",

We want to cross the streams (in the Ghostbuster proton-pack sense) of the Visual Studio IDE and the LLVM-based C++ tools to enable developers to build C++ software better.

Such things as missing semi-colons and mismatched braces prevent compilation and will cause Clang to emit an error message. On the other hand, warnings are emitted on questionable constructs on language conforming code. Over time, certain patterns have been determined to have a strong likelihood of being a programming mistake. Some examples of these include: order of operations confusion, mistaking similarly named language features, and easily made typos that still result in valid code.

The older implementation (llvm::JIT) is a sort of ad hoc implementation that brings together various pieces of the LLVM code generation and adds its own glue to get dynamically generated code into memory one function at a time. The newer implementation (llvm::MCJIT) is heavily based on the core MC library and emits complete object files into memory then prepares them for execution. MCJIT has several advantages, including broader platform support and better tool integration. However, because it is designed to compile entire modules into object images the MCJIT engine doesn’t directly support some key...",

While the debugger has long been the default tool with Xcode, its potential beyond Darwin has had room to grow. Especially within the last year, the development community has grown beyond its roots with OS/X and iOS to include substantial contributions for Linux, Windows, and FreeBSD. In addition, experimental packages are available for a growing number of distributions including Debian, Ubuntu and Arch. Much of the potential draws from the architecture of LLDB. The debugger is well suited to debugging the latest C++ code because of its reuse of LLVM and Clang. This...",

LLVM now has two vectorizers: The Loop Vectorizer, which operates on Loops, and the Basic Block Vectorizer , which optimizes straight-line code. These vectorizers focus on different optimization opportunities and use different techniques. The BB vectorizer merges multiple scalars that are found in the code into vectors while the Loop Vectorizer widens instructions in the original loop to operate on multiple consecutive loop iterations. LLVM’s Loop Vectorizer is now available and will be useful for many people. It is not enabled by default, but can be enabled through clang using the command line flag \"-mllvm...",

Lessons learned from linear scan Linear scan has been the default register allocator in LLVM since 2004. It has worked surprisingly well for such a simple algorithm.

It is a smart alias to other commands that you can define using the \" command regex\" command. You define a regular expression command by giving it a command name followed by a series of regular expression and substitution pairs. The regular expression and substitution pairs are supplied in a standard stream editor search and replace format: s/<regex>/<subst>/ When a command in later entered, it will strip...",

Dragonegg lets you use the LLVM optimizers with GCC-4.5 , much like llvm-gcc , but unlike llvm-gcc does not involve modifying GCC, thanks to the new GCC plugin infrastructure (currently one small patch is required). We built all of GCC-4.5, LLVM and dragonegg with dragonegg, then used the resulting binaries to build them all again. Why? Because we love to build! And because this was a great way of checking that nothing was miscompiled. The final dragonegg plugin was fully functional, successfully passing the entire dragonegg test suite.",

With a reliable disassembler, you can solve high-level problems like tracing back through a program's call stack or analyzing sample-based profiles to low-level problems like figuring out how your compiler unrolled a tight floating-point loop or what advantages declaring a variable const actually had at the other end of the optimization chain. A reliable disassembler, which takes sequences of bytes and prints human-readable instruction mnemonics, is a crucial part of any development platform.

However, self-building indicates that C++ parsing, semantic analysis, and code generation is solid enough to compile the entirety of LLVM (~350k lines of C++ code) and Clang (~200k lines of C++ code) and produce object files that link together properly. To get to this point, we've fixed many bugs in Clang (when compiling C++ code), but also several bugs in LLVM and Clang that were found by Clang itself...",

This post describes some advanced topics and focuses on PHI translation: what it is, why it is important, shows some nice things it can do, and describes the implementation in LLVM. What is PHI Translation All About? When performing redundancy elimination on SSA form, PHI translation is required when we are walking through the CFG and the value being analyzed has an operand defined in the block we're walking through. In the case of load elimination, the operand of the value being analyzed is the pointer we're loading from. This means that PHI translation happens when the...",

One of the most vexing is \"two-phase name lookup\", which involves lookup for any names that occur in the body of a template. As you might expect, there are two different phases of templates: Template definition time: when the template is initially parsed, long before it is instantiated, the compiler parses the template and looks up any \"non-dependent\" names. A name is \"non-dependent\" if the results of name lookup do not depend on any template parameters, and therefore will be the same from one template instantiation to another.

In this post, I introduce and motivate the topic, which will let us expand on it in future posts. Basic Redundant Load Elimination GVN (which stands for \"Global Value Numbering\", though this detail has nothing to do with load elimination) is responsible for the form of load elimination known as redundant load elimination.
