We will explain how we used this recipe to design Clang's -fbounds-safety language extension, Clang's -Wunsafe-buffer-usage programming model and the Clang Static Analyzer's WebKit smart pointer checks. We will also describe the need for new Clang-based static analysis infrastructure to enable faster, lower-developer-cost adoption of these programming models.",

      "abstract": "LLVM has been driving the diversification of compiler-based tools successfully for many years. And we still keep implementing everything in the monorepo upstream. This pulls more and more domain- specific features into general purpose toolchains. The advent of the RealtimeSanitizer in Clang 20 illustrates this very well. Pass plugins allow 3rd-party additions in both, LLVM and MLIR already without further bloat in our codebase. But so far their capabilities are limited. This talk will give an overview of the history and present state of pass plugins. Based on that it proposes an initial set of changes that would allow domain-specific extensions to utilize the plugin interface for sanitizer-like tasks. It's meant as a kick-off to bring interested parties to a round table and discuss how a version 2 of the plugin interface could look like.",

Emphasis is placed on bridging the requirements of the SPIR-V standard, relevant execution environment specifications, and LLVM's code-lowering infrastructure. Key topics include technical solutions for the SPIR-V type system, module vs. function scope handling, and managing the logical layout of modules—factors essential to both performance and maintainability. We also discuss our use of TableGen-based register classes, improvements to type deduction passes, and how these strategies ensure formal correctness while expanding support for SPIR-V extensions, built-ins, and intrinsics. Finally, the talk covers insights into introducing the backend into the DPC++ compiler and OpenAI Triton backend for Intel GPUs, along with details on the broader quality assurance and integration efforts that benefit both compute-centric and graphical use cases alike.",

Additionally, a new safe_thunks mode has been introduced to improve binary size reduction without compromising runtime safety, achieving an additional 0.45% size savings over regular safe ICF. However, function merging poses challenges for symbolication, which have been addressed through enhancements such as a new DWARF attribute and extended GSYM format support, laying the groundwork for more accurate symbolication in optimized binaries.",

By combining the semantic reasoning capbility of LLM(Deepseek V3) with the precision of traditional LLVM-based compilers, we tackle complex vectorization scenarios which is generally hard to be done for naive LLVM-based compilers. We'll share results from TSVC-2 HPC and Skia benchmarks, demonstrating significant performance improvements (1.42× to 1.91×) on SVE/Neon for Arm CPUs. Learn how this approach reshapes auto-vectorization and discover future directions for LLM-native compiler optimization.",

With our tool, IRDL-defined dialects are now tightly integrated into MLIR and indistinguishable from ODS dialects from a user's perspective.

While the transformation utilities exist, determining optimal tiling and fusion decisions is challenging due to the lack of readily available iteration domain mapping information. This talk proposes a new interface to expose this critical mapping independent of the transformation process, enabling more informed and flexible tiling and fusion strategies. By providing a common solution, this interface aims to benefit both in-tree and out-of-tree dialects, addressing challenges faced by downstream projects and improving the broader MLIR ecosystem.",

Previously, at the RISC-V Summit, North America, 2024, we proposed the Sub-FP8 extension for RISC-V, a novel approach to low-precision floating-point computation. In this work, we further provide Sub-FP8 support in the LLVM backend, along with C/C++ intrinsics to facilitate its integration into machine learning workloads. In addition, a reference design of Sub-FP8 is in the on-going work to integrate with CVA6 and FPnew core from open hardware. In our reference design, we also look at the issues to integrate Sub-FP8 with risc-v vector and matrix extensions, respectively. Experiments and simulations with Toolkits such as Spike and Gem5 will be also presented.",

However, programming languages only provide constructs operating at the lower abstraction level of machine encoding arithmetic. This work introduces an MLIR dialect for representing computations on real numbers at a high abstraction level. This enables more opportunities of arithmetic optimizations than those supported by current compilers. Such optimisations are particularly relevant when compiling a high-level mathematical description to application-specific hardware, for instance in signal processing and AI acceleration.",

By leveraging MLIR's shape system, SonicMachine enables explicit representation of interconnections and performance attributes through operations like slice, concat, and broadcast, along with builder functions and templates for scalable descriptions. This work demonstrates how compiler infrastructure can facilitate expressive, hierarchical hardware modeling, providing a foundation for analysis, optimization, and efficient system design.",

We demonstrate the initial stages in the development of our MLIR dialect and the performance of JIT-compiled finite kernels, tested as a back-end for the Nektar++ spectral/hp element framework.",
