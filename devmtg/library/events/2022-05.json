In this talk, we will present a new throughput analysis tool, MCA Daemon (MCAD). It is built on top of LLVM MCA and combines the advantages of both static and dynamic throughput analyses, providing a powerful, fast, and easy-to-use tool that scales up with large-scale programs in the real world.",

      "abstract": "Compilers are foundational software development tools and incorporate increasingly sophisticated optimizations. Due to their complexity, it is difficult to systematically identify opportunities for improving them. Indeed, the automatic discovery of missed optimizations has been an important and significant challenge. We tackle this challenge by introducing a novel, effective approach that, in a simple and general manner, automatically identifies a wide range of missed optimizations. Our core insight is to leverage dead code elimination (DCE) to both analyze how well compilers optimize code and identify missed optimizations: (1) insert \"optimization markers'' in the basic blocks of a given program, (2) compute the program's live/dead basic blocks using the \"optimization markers'', and (3) identify missed optimizations from how well compilers eliminate dead blocks. We have implemented and open-sourced our approach in our tool DEAD. DEAD can automatically find missed optimizations and regressions and generate minimal test cases. We reported over a hundred such bugs in LLVM and GCC most of which have already been confirmed or fixed, demonstrating our work's strong practical utility.",

      "abstract": "Arjun Pitchanathan, University of Edinburgh Since March 2022, MLIR has a Presburger library, FPL, that provides native support for a full set of polyhedral analysis operators. This functionality has already been deployed in the loop fusion pass in the Affine dialect and has also been used to enable better dependence analysis in CIRCT. In this tutorial, we demonstrate several case studies showing how to use FPL’s Presburger arithmetic functionality in MLIR. Reasoning precisely about sets of integers enables accurate analytical cache models and brings powerful transformations to loop optimizers for ML and HPC, formal verification, and hardware design. Despite many efforts to use Presburger arithmetic in LLVM, their use has thus far been confined to optional extensions like Polly due to the need for external Presburger libraries (e.g., isl) that were not part of the core compiler toolchain. In the course of developing FPL we worked closely with the LLVM community to make FPL and Presburger arithmetic available in the MLIR upstream repositories. In this talk, we give a detailed walkthrough and demonstrate how they can be used. Our objective is to overcome the longstanding ‘vendor-lock-in’ and inflexibility of polyhedral toolchains by working with the LLVM community to provide targeted analyses that enhance the native components of the LLVM ecosystem.",

Successfully applying loop optimizations can significantly boost the performance of the operations. Our prototype can compile decryption/encryption, and the generated code is at most 40% faster when run in multi threads than the C++ implementation written using Intel HEXL.",

Compilation, linking and memory management all run on the host machine. Thus, the RPC endpoint on the device is very simple and only takes few kilobytes of flash memory. Right now, ez-clang supports 32-bit ARMv7-m Cortex devices (i.e. Arduino Due and QEMU LM3S811). Please find public previews on https://echtzeit.dev/ez-clang I want to give a live demo of the current development state, an overview of the compiler pipeline based on an example and present the firmware ABI. A binary distribution of ez-clang, sources for two reference firmwares and the RPC interface documentation will be published on https://github.com/echtzeit-dev/ez-clang Give it a try and hack with it on your own hardware! I am looking forward to discuss details from all technical layers and hear your opinions about upcoming development goals!\"",

This talk gives a gentle introduction to CIRCT's scheduling abstractions and presents the currently available infrastructure—including extensible problem models, ready-to-use scheduler implementations and support for external solvers. We discuss current users of the infrastructure and outline future plans for this recent addition to the project.",

We’ve been prototyping a new debug intrinsic which enables LLVM to make smarter decisions for these variables by connecting stores and source assignment markers. In this talk I will briefly outline the problem with the existing system, how the new system works - including how existing passes are affected - and discuss the accuracy and coverage improvements we've found so far.",

In the last year, a significant effort went in to upstreaming this fork. Most of this code is upstreamed and all development has shifted to the llvm-project monorepo. Much development effort has also gone into adding a runtime and lowering for Fortran 95. In parallel, great progress has been achieved on adding a driver, support for OpenMP 1.1+ and OpenACC. In this talk, I will summarize the developmental activities for the last year, the current status and future work.",
