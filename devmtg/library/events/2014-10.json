I will discuss in depth how the new system supports richer analysis dependencies, flexible composition of function-level analyses and module- or call-graph-level transformations. The new pass manager also introduces a caching-based scheduling model which is substantially different from the prior ones and critical to understanding the impact of transitioning. And as I go through these topics I will introduce how to write a pass suitable for the new infrastructure and how to port an existing pass to live happily in both. Finally, I will show a specific new call-graph analysis used by the new pass manager and discuss how these two components can be used to parallelize the entire LLVM compilation pipeline. I will mention some of the basic correctness and efficiency challenges faced when running in parallel and detail the specific challenges and constraints pursuing this path would impose on analysis and optimization passes.",

This talk will discuss an alternative approach that embeds Clang into an LLVM-based compiler front end to provide C compatibility without the traditional FFI. Embedding Clang provides seamless access to C APIs, moving the translation of APIs from external tools into the compiler itself. Moreover, one can leverage Clang's deep knowledge of C record layout and calling conventions to simplify the C interface and make both bring up and porting of a new compiler front end simpler.",
