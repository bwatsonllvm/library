      "abstract": "Glow is an LLVM-based machine learning compiler for heterogeneous hardware that's developed as part of the PyTorch project. It is a pragmatic approach to compilation that enables the generation of highly optimized code for CPUs, GPUs and accelerators. Glow lowers the traditional neural network data-flow graph into a two-phase strongly-typed intermediate representation (inspired by SIL). Finally Glow emits LLVM-IR and uses the LLVM code generator to generate highly-optimized code. In this talk we'll describe the structure of machine learning programs and how Glow is designed to compile these graphs into multiple targets. We'll explain how we use the LLVM infrastructure and go over some of the techniques that we use to generate high-performance code using LLVM.",

It will have immediate impact on what will enter C++20, and beyond. First half of this talk will devote to the Directions Groups description of where future C++ is heading as a member of the DG. It also includes a guidance towards Heterogeneous C++.\n\nThe introduction of the executors TS means for the first time in C++ there will be a standard platform for writing applications which can execute across a wide range of architectures including multi-core and many-core CPUs, GPUs, DSPs, and FPGAs. The SYCL standard from the Khronos Group is a strong candidate to implement this upcoming C++ standard as are many other C++ frameworks from DOE, and HPX for the distributed case. One of the core ideas of this standard is that everything must be standard C++, the only exception being that some feature of C++ cannot be used in places that can be executed on an OpenCL device, often due to hardware limitation.\n\nImplementing Heterogeneous C++ is like battling the four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. These are: Data movement; Data Locality; Data Layout; Data Affinity.\n\nThe rest of this talk presents some of the challenges and solutions to implement a Heterogeneous C++ standard in Clang based on our implementation of Khronos' SYCL language with Codeplay's ComputeCpp compiler, with the fast growth of C++ and Clang being a platform of choice to prototype many of the new C++ features.\n\nWe describe the major issues with ABI for separate compilation tool chain that comes from non-standard layout type of lambdas, as well as the issues of data addressing that comes from non-flat and possibly non-coherent address spaces.\n\nWe also describe various papers which are being proposed to ISO C++ to move towards standardizing heterogeneous and distributed computing in C++. The introduction of a unified interface for execution across a wide range of different hardware, extensions to this to support concurrent exception handling and affinity queries, and an approach to improve the capability of the parallel algorithms through composability. All of this adds up to a future C++ which is much more aware of heterogeneity and capable of taking advantage of it to improve parallelism and performance.",

The Clasp compiler is written in Common Lisp and makes extensive use of the LLVM C++ API and the ORC JIT to generate native code both ahead of time and just in time. Among its unique features, Clasp uses a compacting garbage collector to manage memory, incorporates multithreading, uses C++ compatible exception handling to achieve stack unwinding and an incorporates an advanced compiler written in Common Lisp to achieve performance that approaches that of C++. Clasp is being developed as a high-performance scientific and general purpose programming language that makes use of available C++ libraries.",

It deduplicates common parts of similar functions and outlines them to a separate function thus reducing the code size. This is particularly useful for code bases making heavy use of templates which gets instantiated in multiple translation units. Porting FM to thinlto offers leveraging its functionality to dedupe functions across entire program. I'll discuss the engineering effort required to port FM to thinlto. Specifically, functionality to uniquely identify similar functions, augmenting function summary with a hash code, populating module summary index, modifying bitcode reader+writer, and codesize numbers on open source benchmarks.",

However, it presents challenges to the OpenMP code generation in the LLVM backend, especially when the input program is compiled under different optimization levels. This paper presents a practical and effective framework on how to perform the OpenMP code generation based on the LLVM IR. In this presentation, we propose a canonical OpenMP loop representation under different optimization levels to preserve the OpenMP loop structure without being affected by compiler optimizations. A code-motion guard intrinsic is proposed to prevent code motion across OpenMP regions. In addition, a utility based on the LLVM SSA updater is presented to perform the SSA update during the transformation. Lastly, the scope alias information is used to preserve the alias relationship for backend-outlined functions. This framework has been implemented in Intel’s LLVM compiler.",

      "abstract": "Modern programming languages targeting GPUs include features that are not commonly found in conventional programming languages, such as C and C++, and are, therefore, not natively representable in LLVM IR.\n\nThis limits the applicability of LLVM to target GPU hardware for both graphics and massively parallel compute applications. Moreover, the lack of a unified way to represent GPU-related features has led to different and mutually incompatible solutions across different vendors, thereby limiting interoperability of LLVM-based GPU transformation passes and tools.\n\nMany features within the Vulkan graphics API and language [1] highlight the diversity of GPU hardware. For example, Vulkan allows different attributes on structures that specify different memory padding rules. Such semantic information is currently not natively representable in LLVM IR. Graphics programming models also make extensive use of special memory regions that are mapped as address spaces in LLVM. However, no semantic information is attributed to address spaces at the LLVM IR level and the correct behaviour and transformation rules have to be inferred from the address space within the compilation passes.\n\nAs some of these features have no direct representation in LLVM, various translators, e.g SPIR-V->LLVM translator [2], Microsoft DXIL compiler [3], AMD's OpenSource compiler for Vulkan [4], make use of side features of LLVM IR, such as metadata and intrinsics, to represent the semantic information that cannot be easily captured. This creates an extra burden on compilation passes targeting GPU hardware as the semantic information has to be recreated from the metadata. Additionally, some translators such as the Microsoft DXIL compiler have forked the Clang and LLVM repositories and made proprietary changes to the IR in order to more easily support the required features natively. A more general approach would be to look at how upstream LLVM can be augmented to represent some, if not all, of the semantic information required for massively parallel SIMD, SPMD, and in general, graphics applications.\n\nThis talk will look at the proprietary LLVM IR modifications made in translators such as the Khronos SPIRV-LLVM translator, AMDs open source driver for Vulkan SPIRV, the original Khronos SPIR specification [5], Microsoft's DXIL compiler and Nvidia's NVVM specification [6]. The aim is to extract a common set of features present in modern graphics and compute languages for GPUs, describe how translators are currently representing these features in LLVM and suggest ways of augmenting the LLVM IR to natively represent these features. The intention with this talk is to open up a dialogue among IR developers to look at how we can, if there is agreement, extend LLVM in a way that supports a more diverse set of hardware types.\n\n[1] - https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/ [2] - https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator [3] - https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/blob/master/docs/DXIL.rst [4] - https://github.com/GPUOpen-Drivers/AMDVLK [5] - https://www.khronos.org/registry/SPIR/specs/spir_spec-2.0.pdf [6] - https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/pdf/NVVM_IR_Specification.pdf",

The second way is to build the sub-projects standalone against a pre-compiled build of LLVM.\n\nThis talk will focus on how to make standalone builds of sub-projects like clang, lld, compiler-rt, lldb, and libcxx work and how this method can be used to help reduce build times for both developers and CI systems. In addition, we will look at the cmake helpers provided by LLVM and how they are used during the standalone builds and also how you can use them to build your own LLVM-based project in a standalone fashion.",

Such optimizations can take place on more than one level and the decision for the compiler-level has already been made in LLVM: We already support a small zoo of transformations: Loop unrolling, unroll-and-jam, distribution, vectorization, interchange, unswitching, idiom recognition and polyhedral optimization using Polly. When clear that we want loop optimizations in the compiler, why not making them as good as possible?\n\nToday, with the exception of some shared code and analyses related to vectorization , LLVM loop passes don't know about each other. This makes cooperation between them difficult, and that includes difficulty in heuristically determining whether some combination of transformations is likely to be profitable. With user-directed transformations such as #pragma omp parallel for, #pragma clang loop vectorize(enable), the only order these transformations can be applied is the order of the passes in the pipeline.\n\nIn this talk, we will explore what already works well (e.g. vectorization of inner loops), things that do not work as well (e.g. loop passes destroying each other's structures), things that becomes ugly with the current design if we want to support more loop passes (e.g. exponential code blowup due to each pass doing its own loop versioning) and possible solutions.",

This talk goes into detail of some of these techniques, including using relative references to make metadata position-independent, using mangled type names as a compact and offline-interpretable representation of language concepts, and organizing optional reflection metadata into its own segment of binaries so it can be discovered at load time and optionally stripped from binaries in cases where it is not desired. These techniques could also be applied to other languages, including C++, to reduce the costs of these data structures.",

As we are currently working to remedy this situation, we want to share our experience in designing, implementing, and tuning a new loop transformation pass. While we want to explain how loop fusion can be implemented using the set of existing analyses, we also plan to talk about the current loop transformation framework and extensions thereof. We currently plan to include:\n\n- The interplay between different existing loop transformations. - A comparison to the IBM/XL loop optimization pipeline. - Source level guidance of loop transformations. - Shortcomings of the current infrastructure, especially loop centric dependence analyses. - Interaction with polyhedral-model-backed dependence information.\n\nThe (default) loop optimizations performed by LLVM are currently lacking transformations and tuning. One reason is the absence of a dedicated framework that provides the necessary analyses information and heuristics. With the introduction of loop fusion we want to explore how different transformations could be used together and what a uniform dependence analysis for multiple loops could look like. The latter is explored with regards to a Scalar Evolution (or SCEV) based dependence analysis, like the current intra-loop access analysis, and a polyhedral-model-based alternative, e.g., via LLVM/Polly or the Polyhedral Value/Memory Analysis [4].\n\nAs our work is still ongoing, we cannot provide evaluation results at this point. However, earlier efforts [3], that did not make it into LLVM, already showed significant improvements which we expect to replicate. We anticipate having preliminary performance results available to present at the conference.\n\nNote that the goal of this talk is not necessarily to provide final answers to the above described problems, but instead we want to start a discussion and bring interested parties together.\n\n[1] https://reviews.llvm.org/D7008 [2] https://reviews.llvm.org/D17386 [3] https://llvm.org/devmtg/2015-04/slides/LLVMEuro2015LoopFusionAmidComplexControlFlow.pdf [4] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSA0XLYJ-G0",

Importantly, the use of class/struct objects and (parallel) runtime libraries commonly introduce indirections that prohibit basically all optimizations. In this talk, we introduce these problems with real-world examples and show how new analyses can mitigate them. We especially focus on:\n\n- A field-sensitive, inter-procedural memory analysis that models simple communication through memory. - The integration of indirect, potentially hidden, call sites, e.g., in libraries like the OpenMP runtime library, into existing analysis and optimizations (function attribute detection, argument promotion, …). - Automatic and portable (non-LLVM specific) information transfer from library implementations through their interfaces to the user sites.\n\nWhile our work originates in the optimization of parallel code, we want to show how the problems we encountered there are similar to existing ones in sequential programs. To this end, we try to augment the available analyses and optimizations rather than introducing new ones that are specific to parallel programs. As a consequence, we not only expect positive results for parallel code regions [1], but also hope to improve generic code that employs indirections or simply exhibit optimization opportunities similar to the ones that commonly arise for parallel programs.\n\nThe goal of this talk is to introduce possible solutions to several problems that commonly prevent optimization of code featuring indirections. As we want to introduce these solutions into the LLVM codebase, we hope to start a discussion on these issues as well as the caveats that we encountered while resolving them.\n\n[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2Soj49R-i4",

      "abstract": "We recently proposed adding an alternative VPlan native path in Loop Vectorizer (LV) to implement support for outer loop vectorization. In this presentation, we first give a status update and discuss progress made since our initial proposal. We briefly talk about the addition of a VPlan-native code path in LV, initial explicit outer loop vectorization support, cost modelling and vector code generation in the VPlan-native path. We also summarize the current limitations.\n\nNext, we introduce VPlan-to-VPlan transformations, which highlight a major strength of VPlan infrastructure. Different vectorization strategies can be modelled using the VPlan representation which allows reuse of VPlan-based cost modelling and code generation infrastructure. Starting from an initial VPlan, a set of VPlan-to-VPlan transformations can be applied, resulting in a set of plans representing different optimization strategies (e.g. interleaving of memory accesses, using SLP opportunities, predication). These plans can then be evaluated against each other and code generated for the most profitable one. We present VPlan-based SLP and predication as concrete examples of VPlan-to-VPlan transformation.\n\nWe end this talk with a discussion of the next steps in the VPlan roadmap. In particular, we discuss plans to achieve convergence of the inner loop and VPlan-native vectorization paths. We present opportunities to get involved with VPlan development and possibilities for collaboration. Furthermore, we discuss how vectorization for scalable vector architectures could fit into VPlan. We also plan to organize a VPlan focused hacker’s table after the talk, to provide a space for more in-depth discussions relating to VPlan.",

As the VPlan infrastructure is maturing it becomes apparent that the support API provided by the LLVM ecosystem needs to evolve with it. Apart from short SIMD, new ISAs such as ARM SVE, the RISC-V V extension and NEC SX-Aurora pose new requirements and challenges to vectorization in LLVM. To this end, the Region Vectorzer is a great experimentation ground for dealing with issues that sooner or later will need to be resolved for the LLVM vectorization infrastructure. These include the design of a flexible replacment for the VECLIB mechanism in TLI, inter-procecural vectorization and the development of a LLVM-SVE backend for NEC SX-Aurora. The idea of the talk is to provide data points to inform vectorization-related design decisions in LLVM based on our experience with the Region Vectorizer.",

In this talk, we will describe how we have sped up the analyzer by changing the order in which it explores programs to bias it towards covering code that hasn’t been explored yet. In contrast with the previous exploration strategy, which was based on depth-first search, this coverage-guided approach gives shorter, more understandable bug reports and can find up to 20% more bugs on typical code bases. We will also explain how we’ve reduced C++ false positives by providing infrastructure in Clang’s control-flow graph to help the analyzer understand the myriad of ways in which C++ objects can be constructed, destructed, and have their lifetime extended. This infrastructure will also make it easier for the analyzer to support C++ as the language continues to evolve.",

Internally, ORC’s symbol resolution scheme has been replaced with a system that provides transactional, batch symbol queries. This new scheme both exposes opportunities for parallel compilation within the JIT, and provides a basis for synchronizing interdependent JIT tasks when they reach the JIT linker stage. Alongside this query system, a new “Responsibility” API is introduced to track compilation tasks and enforce graceful termination of the JIT (and JIT’d code) in the event of unrecoverable IPC/RPC failures or other errors. In this talk we will describe the new design, how the API has changed, and the implementation details of the new symbol resolution and responsibility schemes. We will also talk about new developments in the ORC C APIs, and discuss future directions for LLVM’s JIT APIs.",

This has led to a diverse set of software tools and paradigms such as CUDA, OpenMP, Cilk, and many others to best exploit a program’s parallelism for performance gain. Yet, while such tools provide us ways to express parallelism, they come at a large cost to the programmer, requiring in depth knowledge of what to parallelize, how to best map the parallelism to the hardware, and having to rework the code to match the programming model chosen by the software tool.\n\nIn this talk, we discuss how to use Tapir, a parallel extension to LLVM, to optimize parallel programs. We will show how one can use Tapir/LLVM to represent programs in attendees’ favorite parallel framework by extending clang, how to perform various optimizations on parallel code, and how to to connect attendees’ parallel language to a variety of parallel backends for execution (PTX, OpenMP Runtime, Cilk Runtime).",

The aim of this BoF is to bring together developers and other parties interested in the state and future progress of GlobalISel, and to discuss some issues that would benefit from community feedback. We will first give a short update on progress within the past year. Possible discussion topics include:\n\n• The current design of GISel’s pipeline, with particular focus on how well the architecture will scale as the focus on optimisation increases. • For new backends, how is the experience in bringing up a GlobalISel based code generator? For existing backends, are there any impediments to continuing development? • Does using GlobalISel mean that double the work is necessary with more maintenance costs? How can this be mitigated? • Are there additional features that developers would like to see in the framework? What SelectionDAG annoyances should we take particular care to avoid or improve upon?",

      "abstract": "Explicit parallelism and offloading support is an important and growing part of LLVM’s eco-system for CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs and accelerators. LLVM's optimizer has not traditionally been involved in explicit parallelism and offloading support, and specifically, the outlining logic and lowering translation into runtime-library calls resides in Clang. While there are several reasons why the optimizer must be involved in parallelization in order to suitably handle a wide set of applications, the design an appropriate parallel IR for LLVM remains unsettled. Several groups (ANL, Intel, MIT, UIUC) have been experimenting with implementation techniques that push this transformation process into LLVM's IR-level optimization passes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. These efforts all aim to allow the optimizer to leverage language properties and optimize parallel constructs before they're transformed into runtime calls and outlined functions. Over the past couple of years, these groups have implemented out-of-tree extensions to LLVM IR to represent and optimize parallelism, and these designs have been influenced by community RFCs [6] and discussions on this topic. In this BoF, we will discuss the use cases we'd like to address and several of the open design questions, including:\n\n* Is a canonical loop form necessary for parallelization and vectorization? * What is the SSA update requirements for extensive loop parallelization and transformation? * What are the required changes to, and impact on, existing LLVM optimization passes and analyses? E.g. inlining and aliasing-information propagation * How to represent and leverage language properties of parallel constructs in LLVM IR? * Where is the proper place in the pipeline to lower these constructs?\n\nThe purpose of this BoF is to bring together all parties interested in optimizing parallelism and offloading support in LLVM, as well as the experts in parts of the compiler that will need to be modified. Our goal is to discuss the gap between ideal and reality and identify the pieces that are still missing. In the best case we expect interested parties to agree on the next steps towards better parallelism support Clang and LLVM.",

      "abstract": "In mathematics and computer algebra, automatic differentiation (AD) is a set of techniques to evaluate the derivative of a function specified by a computer program. AD exploits the fact that every computer program, no matter how complicated, executes a sequence of elementary arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.) and elementary functions (exp, log, sin, cos, etc.) including control flow statements. AD takes source code of a function as input and produces source code of the derived function. By applying the chain rule repeatedly to these operations, derivatives of arbitrary order can be computed automatically, accurately to working precision, and using at most a small constant factor more arithmetic operations than the original program.\n\nAD is an alternative technique to symbolic and numerical differentiation. These classical methods run into problems: symbolic differentiation leads to inefficient code (unless done carefully) and faces the difficulty of converting a computer program into a single expression, while numerical differentiation can introduce round-off errors in the discretization process and cancellation. Both classical methods have problems with calculating higher derivatives, where the complexity and errors increase. Finally, both classical methods are slow at computing the partial derivatives of a function with respect to many inputs, as is needed for gradient-based optimization algorithms. AD solves all of these problems, at the expense of introducing more software dependencies.\n\nOur talk presents our AD tool, clad -- a clang plugin that can produce derivatives of arbitrary C/C++ functions through implementing source code transformation and employing the chain rule of differential calculus in both forward mode and reverse mode. That is, clad decomposes the original functions into elementary statements and generates their derivatives with respect to the user-defined independent variables. The combination of these intermediate expressions forms additional source code, built through modifying clang’s abstract syntax tree (AST) along the control flow. Compared to other tools, clad has the advantage of relying on clang and llvm modules for parsing the original program. It uses clang's plugin mechanism for constructing the derivative's AST representation, for generating executable code, and for performing global analysis. Thus it results in low maintenance, high compatibility and excellent performance.\n\nThis work was presented as a poster at the LLVM Dev Meeting 2013 (https://llvm.org/devmtg/2013-11/slides/Vassilev-Poster.pdf). Recent advancements in minimization and machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow have made the topic increasingly interesting to a broader audience. We would like to present the current state of the clad, explain the major concept and discuss the implementation strategies. We will briefly explain how clad is used in CERN’s data analysis framework ROOT. Last but not least, we intend to outline common problems when developing clang plugins such as API stability, missing testing tools from the regular LLVM binary installations and writing compatible across versions plugin infrastructure.",

In this talk, we show how the C2Rust clang plugin breaks the \"immutable AST\" rule by mutating the AST in two significant ways: * Adding new statements to existing C functions, and * Creating new C functions that are passed back to clang for compilation. Additionally, the plugin adds a C language extension in the form of a new \"cross_check\" attribute for functions, structures and structure fields. This new attribute helps users configure and customize the inserted instrumentation code. We discuss how the plugin implements this attribute, and the alternative implementation approaches we considered.",

      "abstract": "Takeaways: 1. how to test a Clang/LLVM tool chain using the latest GCC test suite; 2. examples of production tool chains where this has been used; and 3. a demonstration of the tests in action.\n\nWhen starting a new port of a compiler, it is important to have a set of good tests in order to ensure correct backend functionality. The size of each test case is important, especially in the case of deeply embedded targets where memory may be extremely scarce. Early in a port, there are the additional challenges that only minimal libraries may be implemented and no I/O may be available, adding additional constraints on a test.\n\nAs such, a high quality test suite needs to meet these requirements:\n\n- Freestanding C environment - Reasonable coverage of compiler features, both standard and extensions - Small (for embedded) - Tests the full tool chain - compile -> link -> execute - Quick to port\n\nOne good candidate is the GCC test suite, which has been used for over 30 years. As a generic C/C++ test suite, it is highly portable between architectures and is used in the testing of countless GCC backends, typically running around 90,000 C tests and around 60,000 C++ tests. The use of GCC tests with LLVM is already well known - a fork of the test suite from GCC 4.2 exists in the clang-tests repository, but has remained based on that version for a number of years and is now 11 years old. As such this version is now dated - it lacks for example tests of newer C/C++ standards.\n\nThere are challenges with using the current GCC regression suite for Clang. This test suite is a mix of C compliance tests, GNU C extension compliance tests, GCC internal tests, C torture tests, as well as regression tests. Some groups of tests can be excluded when they are not appropriate, but many individual tests need to be manually evaluated. Clearly tests of the GCC internals are irrelevant to LLVM.\n\nOver the past several years we have been working on solving these limitations by making the GCC test suite more generic, allowing the latest version to be used with a wider selection of tool chains. It can now be used to test compilers that support a similar flag structure to GCC. We initially set this up for a small number of projects as an in-house project at Embecosm. This has since been made generic and publicly available, so can be used with a wider range of targets. Our goal is to merge this upstream with the GCC test suite. It will then be possible for future GCC tests to be picked up for all LLVM targets without significant modification.\n\nIn this talk we will review the approaches that have previously been used for this type of testing. We will then explain how to use our port of the GCC test suite for testing Clang based tool chains for a deeply embedded target. We will consider the challenges in having this adopted upstream in GCC. We will illustrate this with existing production processors and with a demonstration using our public testing of embedded RISC-V.",

      "abstract": "In this talk, I will present a new option --crosscheck-with-z3 added to the static analyzer to validate (or refute) bugs, using an SMT solver.\n\nThe clang static analyzer works by symbolically executing a program, collecting the symbols and constraints for every path in the program, and reasoning about bug feasibility using a built-in solver called RangedConstraintManager. It was designed to be fast, so that it can provide results for common mistakes (e.g., division by zero or use of uninitialized variables) even in complex programs. However, the speed comes at the expense of precision; it cannot handle some arithmetic operations (e.g, remainders) or bitwise expressions. In these cases the analyzer discards the constraints and might report false bugs.\n\nThe new option works by adding an extra step in the program analysis after the bug is found by the built-in solver but before reporting it to the user; the path and the constraints that trigger the bug are encoded in SMT and checked for satisfiability.\n\nI will also present an evaluation of the crosscheck when analyzing eleven C/C++ open-source projects of various size (tmux, redis, openssl, twin, git, postgresql, sqlite3, curl, libWebM, memcached, xerces-c, and XNU). When analyzing these projects with bug validation enabled, the slowdown is negligible in cases where no bug is refuted (average 2.5% slowdown) and, when it finds false bugs, the bug validation gives a small speed up (average 5.1% speed up). On average, 12.2 bugs per program were refuted by the SMT solver, ranging from 1 bug refuted in redis to 51 being refuted in XNU.",

The PMU-based code coverage does not include an instrumentation step and reuses the existing binaries, so the workflow is simple and there is no memory use overhead. For this work we extended SampleProfileLoader pass to compute provably executed source lines from perf samples.

Vectorizing a function is necessary when a programmer writes a function that operates on a single element (or work item) and wants to execute it on multiple elements (or work items), through SIMD execution units. Compilation of OpenMP declare simd functions and OpenCL kernels, for SIMD targets, fits in this profile. A naïve approach is to write a purpose built vectorizer that is tuned to vectorize functions. However, since vectorizer is a complicated optimization pass which consists of many components including optimization, cost model and code generation, both the development and the maintenance are big headaches. Therefore, since there are great similarities between vectorizing a loop and vectorizing a function, we decided to use the LoopVectorizer to vectorize functions. In this talk, we present how OpenMP and OpenCL kernel functions are transformed in such a way that they can be vectorized through the standard LoopVectorizer. We call this optimization pass VecClone.",

However, improper memory management in ISL leads to invocations of runtime errors. Hence, we have added support to Clang Static Analyzer for performing reference counting of ISL objects (although with the current implementation, it can be used for any type of C/C++ object) thereby enabling the static analyzer to raise warnings in case there is a possibility of a memory leak, bad release, etc.",

One concrete example is the LLVMDebugInfoDWARF library, which provides interfaces to extract information about DWARF debug sections from a file. Some clients, such as llvm-dwarfdump, don't want to fail immediately when there is a parsing issue, but may still want to emit an error. On the other hand, LLD uses this library to provide additional information in error messages and may not even want to warn in the event of an issue.\n\nSo, what should LLVM libraries do if they encounter a problem when executing a function? Libraries need to provide a rich enough interface that allows getting useful information in the event of an error, without making those errors terminal to the program as a whole. There are already existing mechanisms to do this in LLVM, but using them appropriately requires careful thought.\n\nUsing work performed on the DWARF debug line parser earlier this year as an example, this talk will show some of the pitfalls and problems a library developer has to be aware of when handling errors in their code, and will present some good rules of thumb that should be followed.",

      "abstract": "Gaining fine-grain control over pass management\n\n``opt`` is a great tool to schedule passes, test new combinations and prototype new interactions. However one quickly finds limitations: it is impossible to apply a function pass to a single function, to change the pass options on a per case usage, etc. There is nothing in the pass manager infrastructure preventing these enhancements, so we implemented a first interactive shell, ``optsh``, to provide these features.\n\nStill, the abstraction provided by the pass manager is not enough. In the context of code obfuscation, we reached limitations with this mechanism to perform fine grain transformations combinations when the choice of security vs. performance tradeoff must be delegated to the end-user.\n\nConsidering the Control Flow Graph Flattening transformation [0] which basically encodes the control flow of a function into a dispatcher, no extra obfuscation layer is performed on the newly generated Flow Dispatcher, as the user can't target this code with a pragma, function name etc (because it wasn't there at first).\n\nTo answer these needs, we abstracted the passes with a set of inputs and outputs, to describe their effects more precisely, and gain control over their interdependencies in order to chain them. For instance:\n\nDispatcher, Others = ControlFlowGraphFlattening(F) DuplicateBasicBlock(F) OpaqueConstants(Dispatcher)\n\nHowever, it raises issues about the component validity as the Flow Dispatcher returned by the Control Flow Graph Flattening transformation may not exist anymore after another transformation that could for instance split it.\n\nThis talk is about the new abstractions we are developping, some based on the new LLVM pass manager. Although we use code obfuscation as an illustration, we believe the ideas can be applied to a larger set of problems and appeal to a wider audience.\n\n[0] https://www.inf.u-szeged.hu/~akiss/pub/pdf/laszlo_obfuscating.pdf",

      "abstract": "Software product releases are usually built with compiler optimization at level -O2 or –O3. Investigating customer reported issues often involves loading the core-file in a debugger and analyzing cause of crash or assert. Unfortunately, most of the parameters in call trace are reported as optimized-out, because parameter passing registers are reused and most parameters are not live in the current frame past the function call, hence optimized-out in debug jargon. An attempt to ease this problem comes from a key technique used by expert software developers: go one level up into caller frame and look at the source or disassembly to see if caller has the values of the same arguments. This additional manual step in debugger is time consuming and error prone for experienced developers. But it is impossible for novice users and developers unfamiliar with ISA and ABI calling conventions. With the additional call-site and callee DWARF debug information specified in DWARF 5, this process can be automated in debugger. We have a prototype working in LLVM compiler which is recovering and reporting some optimized-out parameters. Our approach is improving availability of location information for parameters significantly. We will share our results and our insights about implementing it in LLVM, in this poster submission.",

In this poster we discuss the design and implementation of the RISC-V compression feature in LLVM. RISC-V compression was designed in a modular way where compression patterns could be added incrementally; this included writing a new table gen backend that can parse compression patterns and generate necessary code to check for compression legality of an MC instruction and generated the compressed MC instruction. The generated code is called late in the compilation during the emit stage of the, this allowed us to have a centralized location for compression logic for the compiler and the assembler. Automatic compression backend in LLVM provided ~20% improvement in code size for the SPEC benchmark. Similar to the results we observed in GCC.",

The Machine Code (MC) Layer contains target-specific information to represent machine instructions, and it is the core of the LLVM backend. Our tool aims to expose any bugs in the MC by testing it thoroughly. This maximizes the test coverage of the many architecture variants that result from combining the RISC-V base ISA with its standard and custom extensions. Guaranteeing correctness is important because the MC Layer is used to build several tools, including assemblers and disassemblers. Using the same structured fuzzing technology as the clang-proto-fuzzer tool, we implement the llvm-mc-assemble-proto-fuzzer tool for the RISC-V assembler. We describe the grammar of the RISC-V assembly language using Google’s Protocol Buffer language, which provides the fuzzer’s mutator a structured way to permute input. We also implement an assembler/disassembler driver that tests the full assembler–disassembler loop, using a reference “golden” disassembler. These tools are being developed during my summer internship in the San Diego LLVM team at the Qualcomm Innovation Center.",
