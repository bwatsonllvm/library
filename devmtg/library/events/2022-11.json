LLVM IR can be represented on top of MLIR's data structures, but in practice it uses its own data structures. That creates a barrier in compilation pipelines and has other downsides. Is there hope for unification on a single set of data structures? How can we move towards such a goal? Let me show you a framework for thinking about these questions and some concrete ideas for how we can move in the right direction.",

The C/C++ library functions are partially implemented for direct device execution and otherwise fallback to remote procedure call (RPC) to call host functions transparently.

However, the need for more sophisticated and varied predictions has become more pronounced with the development of deep learning compilers which need to optimize dataflow graphs. Such compilers usually employ a much higher level MLIR form as an IR representation. A static/analytical cost model is cumbersome and error prone for such systems. We develop a machine learning-based cost model for high-level MLIR which can predict different target variables of interest such as CPU/GPU/xPU utilization, instructions executed, register usage etc. by considering the incoming MLIR as a text input a la NLP models. The learnt model can be deployed to estimate the target variable of interest for a new computation graph. We report early work in progress results of developing such a model and show that these models can provide reasonably good estimates with low error bounds.",

Ideally, an analysis tool would pick the best-fit representation that preserves interesting semantic features. Such a representation would know the precise relationships between low-level constructs in IR and the analyzed source code. LLVM IR is rarely the best fit representation for program analysis. In this talk, we will look at how we can improve the situation using an MLIR infrastructure called VAST. VAST is an MLIR library for multi-level C/C++ representation. With VAST, an analysis does not need to commit to a single best fit. Instead, an analysis can have simultaneous visibility into multiple progressions of the code, from very high-level down to very low-level.",

We demonstrate our MLIR dialect (https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07272) which encode core functional programming concepts within the SSA style. However, having a fully functional backend is not enough; We discuss the worries around MLIR adoption in the Lean4 community, and the discussions that led to Lean4 choosing to adopt LLVM for the time being. We discuss our current LLVM backend effort for Lean4 (https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/1497), and end with a discussion of how the MLIR community could help with the adoption of MLIR for functional programming languages.",

YARPGen's internal intermediate representation allows us to lower generated tests to C, C++, DPC++, and ISPC. Along with an automated testing system, this new version of YARPGen has discovered more than 120 bugs in compilers such as Clang, GCC, the ISPC compiler, and the DPC++ compiler, in addition to finding a comparable number of bugs in proprietary compilers.",

Some instructions such as comparisons only operate on all 64 bits and require smaller values to be extended. The ABI also requires 32-bit arguments and return values to be sign extended to 64 bits.

Clang Tidy can help modernize large code bases using automatic code rewrites. While there are some out of tree Clang-based static analysis tools, CSA and Clang Tidy were the go-to solutions for the static analysis needs of the community. However, during the last year, a couple of RFCs surfaced on the mailing list to add a dataflow analysis framework to Clang and introduce a MLIR based new IR. Come and join this panel discussion to learn how to get involved in the ongoing static analysis projects, what the new proposals mean for our loved and proven tools, and what does the future holds for static analysis in Clang. You will have the opportunity to ask questions from some of the code owners of these tools, and authors of the new proposals.",

The focus will be mainly on the three conversion algorithms used, specifically W.D Clinger’s Fast Path, the Eisel-Lemire fast_float algorithm, and Nigel Tao’s Simple Decimal Conversion. I will explain the overview of how they work and how they fit together to create a complete strto implementation. Finally, I’ll demonstrate how this makes it faster than existing libc implementations, specifically about 15% faster than glibc.",

      "abstract": "Inlining for size is critical in mobile apps as app size continues to grow. While a link-time optimization (LTO) largely minimizes the app size at minimum size optimization (-Oz), a scalable link-time optimization (ThinLTO) misses many inline opportunities because each module inliner works independently without modeling the size cost globally. We first show how to use the ModuleInliner with LTO. Then, we describe how to improve inlining with ThinLTO by extending the bitcode summary, followed by a global inline analysis. We also explain how to overcome import restrictions, often appearing in Objective-C or Swift, by pre-merging bitcode modules. We reduced the code size by 2.8% for SocialApp, 4.0% for ChatApp, and 3.0% for Clang, compared to -Oz with ThinLTO.",

This talk discusses a compiler and linker implementation that roughly follows the ideas presented in Edler von Koch, highlighting differences in our implementation that offer significant advantages.",

We then discuss how MLIR has been used by three different efforts, including one led by us, to significantly advance the state of the art in FHE tooling. While MLIR has brought great benefits to the FHE community, we also want to highlight some of the challenges experienced when introducing the framework to a new domain.

Unfortunately, when building an instrumented binary with -Oz, the “.text\" size overhead is much larger than what we’d expect from the injected instrumentation instructions alone. In fact, even if we block instrumentation for all functions we still get a 15% “.text\" size overhead from extra passes added by IRPGO. This talk explores the flags we can use to create a function entry coverage instrumented binary with a “.text\" size overhead of 4% or smaller.",

Some DWARF programs are difficult to interpret and check for correctness in their assembly-language format. Currently, checking a DWARF expression requires the building of an executable with debuginfo and running the executable in a debugger, such as LLDB. We propose and have begun a fun project to construct a small suite of tools to aid in construction and checking of non-trivial DWARF programs.",

LAGrad leverages the value semantics of linalg-on-tensors in MLIR to simplify the analyses required to generate adjoint code that is efficient in terms of both run time and memory consumption. LAGrad also combines AD with MLIR’s type system to exploit structured sparsity patterns such as lower triangular tensors. We compare performance results to Enzyme, a state of the art AD system, on Microsoft’s ADBench suite. Our results show speedups of up to 2x relative to Enzyme and in some cases use 30x less memory.",
